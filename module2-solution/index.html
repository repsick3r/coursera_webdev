			<p id="p"> The Basics of Making a Chicken Curry | Tips To Cook Chicken Curry
			You'll have to agree, cooking a chicken curry recipe is a skill. The meat should be cooked delicately and can be bathed, steeped, stewed or simmered in the gravy. Once the oil starts separating, you know your base is ready. It's good to cook the chicken separately and then add it to the base allowing the rich and redolent flavours to seep through. A perfect chicken gravy recipe in its full glory is nothing short of a masterpiece. </p>
